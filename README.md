# React Calendar

Continuous Calendar is a bare-bones calendar built with React and Tailwindcss. It does not include event creation and display, as that's left up to your discretion.

### So what does it do? âœ¨

- Connects to a Calendar API (DAViCal + ICS) :  [Calendar-API](https://github.com/Andrew672/Calendar-API)
- Displays a calendar
- Allows you to navigate through months
- Allows you to select a date
- Add, modify, and delete events
